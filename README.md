# ‚úàÔ∏è Sky Analytics: Navigating the Complexities of Airline and Airport Operations

## üìã Project Description

SkyNet Analysis Inc., a leader in aviation analytics, seeks to uncover actionable insights from large-scale flight operations data. With the aviation industry's increasing complexity, delays, cancellations, and resource utilization have become critical factors for efficiency and customer satisfaction.

This project leverages **Microsoft Excel** to analyze three integrated datasets‚Äî`flights.csv`, `airlines.csv`, and `airports.csv`. Using advanced Excel features such as pivot tables, slicers, and calculated fields, a dynamic and interactive dashboard was developed to explore airline and airport performance, delay trends, and cancellation patterns.

## üíæ Project Files Description

- `flights.csv`: Contains ~70,000 records of flight-level operational data.
- `airlines.csv`: Lookup table for airline codes and full names.
- `airports.csv`: Metadata for airports including geolocation.
- **Excel Workbook**: Includes cleaned and merged data, pivot analyses, and the interactive dashboard.
- **Visualizations**: Embedded charts, KPIs, and slicer-enabled analysis in Excel.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement

Flight disruptions‚Äîespecially delays and cancellations‚Äîcan significantly affect airline efficiency and customer satisfaction. This project addresses the following:

- Which airlines and airports operate most efficiently?
- What are the main causes of delays?
- Are disruptions influenced by time of day, day of week, or season?
- How can airlines improve fleet utilization and schedule reliability?

By exploring these questions, the project provides stakeholders with the tools to make data-driven decisions for optimizing air travel operations.

## üß≠ Slicer Functionality in Dashboard

Interactive slicers allow users to dynamically explore performance metrics:

- **By Airline**: Compare KPIs across different carriers
- **By Month**: Identify seasonal delay and traffic patterns
- **By Time Slot**: Detect peak operational hours and bottlenecks
- **By Cancellation Status**: Filter only disrupted flights for root cause analysis

## üéØ Conclusion 

The Excel dashboard enables a powerful, interactive exploration of aviation operations:

- Provides real-time answers to questions about which airlines or airports perform best  
- Helps identify bottlenecks caused by operational inefficiencies or environmental factors  
- Equips decision-makers with data-driven insights for scheduling, resource planning, and service enhancements  

By leveraging Excel‚Äôs visualization and analytical capabilities, the project transforms raw aviation data into strategic intelligence for **smarter skies**‚Äîempowering stakeholders to make informed, efficient, and customer-centric decisions.
